        Paderborn.js is a usergroup focused on JavaScript and related topics. We
        meet regularly at <a href="https://enpit.de/" rel="noopener">Enpit</a>, Marienplatz 11a in Paderborn.
      </p>
      <p>
        We welcome a diverse range of topics that are related in any way to
        JavaScript and the community around it. New speakers, experienced
        speakers, and everyone in between. If you have an idea you arenâ€™t sure
        about, just reach out or add it as an issue in our Paderborn.js{' '}
