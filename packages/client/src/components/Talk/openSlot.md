This slot is still open. Feel free to [submit a talk](https://github.com/paderbornjs/talks#submitting-a-talk)! First-timers and beginners are welcome. We manage a list of [talk ideas](https://github.com/paderbornjs/talks/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Talk+Idea%22) on our Github talks repository.

Lightning talks or short presentations of something you’ve built are awesome. You don’t need a polished set of slides!
